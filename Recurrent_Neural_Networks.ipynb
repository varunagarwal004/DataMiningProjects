        "I attemped to use more layers in order to try to increase the accuracy of the model. This did help with the accuracy because the RNN had more information and weights to use when predicting characters.\n",
        "I used different activation methods which greatly increased the speed and accuracy of the model after adding the second layer because relu was more applicable.\n",
        "I also increased the number of epochs and the input node size so that there would be more connections in the neural network and so the training would run more times. This would strengthen the proper weights in the NN so that we would get a better model.\n",
        "I increased the sequence length and got a worse model, so I reverted back to 10. This might have happened because when I increased the length, the computer power was more, so I had to decrease the number of epochs so it would run in a reasonable time, which would reduce the accuracy. Similarly, I attempted to use Dropout regularization, but it did not end up increasing the accuracy or predicting a better set of characters.\n",
